// Model a Mega Sena ticket such that a one-dimensional array of 6 to 20 numbers is received by the constructor. Assume the numbers are valid, in order, and non-repeating.

// After that, implement a method that receives the six winning numbers, in the order they were drawn, and returns the number of matches.

// Provide another method that returns, depending on the case, one of the following messages:
// "sena", "quina", "quadra", or "not a winner".

class MegaSena {
  constructor(private array: number){}
