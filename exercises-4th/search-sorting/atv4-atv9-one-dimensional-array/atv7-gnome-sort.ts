// GNOME SORT â€“ Gnome Sort is a simpler algorithm than the bubble method itself. 
// It is based on the ancient technique in which garden gnomes sort flower pots from smallest to largest. 
// Since the pots are heavy, the little gnomes cannot carry them over long distances. 
// So, they compare and exchange them only two by two. 
// Basically, the gnome looks at the flower pot in front of him and also at the previous pot. 
// If they are in the correct order, the gnome goes to the next pot in the sequence. 
// Otherwise, the gnome exchanges one pot for the other and returns to the previous pot. 
// The limit conditions are: (1) if there is no previous pot, the gnome goes to the next pot; and (2) if there is no next pot, the job is over. 
// Thinking computationally, the algorithm extracted from this logic also goes through the sequence comparing elements two by two. 
// As soon as it finds an element in the wrong position, that is, a larger number before a smaller one, it swaps the position of the elements, and goes back with the element that was out of order until it finds its respective place. 
// The following are the steps to order the sequence of the first line.
